# Choatic Company

This is the [Chaotic Company](https://github.com/IsaacdmDunn/Chaotic-Company) mod.

It randomises all values that I could find in the LC code and changes the following but not limited to...

* All enemy speed and spawn rates
* Starting scrap, quota, and shop items 
* Item properties such as flashlight brightness and jetpack power
* Dungeon and overworld havard and scrap spawn rates as well as dungeon size.
* Player stats such as running speed, health and jump height.
* Randomises weather.

Enjoy.
